                                or more of the Supplier Personnel is not in the best interests of Capital One, then Supplier

                                appropriate set of reports to be issued by Supplier to Capital One at a frequency reasonably
                                requested by Capital One; and (b) an appropriate set of performance review meetings to

                                       proposed subcontractor and the proposed site from which such Services would be
                                       provided. Supplier shall perform thorough due diligence on any proposed
                                       subcontractor to ensure compliance with the applicable terms of the Agreement,
                                       which due diligence may include site visits, financial research and other
                                       investigation required by Capital One. Supplier shall forward to Capital One a
                                       description of the scope and material terms (other than financial terms but
                                       including any key performance metrics) of the proposed agreement. Supplier’s
                                       agreements with its subcontractors shall require of such subcontractors the same
                                       level of risk mitigation as Capital One requires of Supplier in the Agreement,
                                       including as provided in Articles 9 (Audits; Records Retention), 13 (Confidentiality;
                                       Safeguarding of Information), 14 (Compliance with Laws and Policies), 15

                                       17 (Indemnities).      Capital One may approve or disapprove proposed
                                       subcontractors in its sole discretion. No such approval shall be deemed a waiver
                                       of any of Capital One’s rights or Supplier’s obligations under the Agreement.
                                (B)    Capital One shall approve Supplier’s use of the subcontractors listed in each
                                       Statement of Work as "Approved Subcontractors", but only for the scope of
                                       performance therein described.
                                (C)    Capital One may revoke its approval of an Approved Subcontractor and direct
                                       Supplier to replace such Approved Subcontractor if:(i) the Approved
                                       Subcontractor's performance is materially deficient; (ii) good faith doubts exist
                                       concerning the Approved Subcontractor's ability to render future performance
                                       because of prior performance or changes in the Approved Subcontractor's
                                       ownership, management, financial condition, or otherwise; or (iii) there have been
                                       material misrepresentations by or concerning the Approved Subcontractor.
                                       Approval of an Approved Subcontractor that is at the time an Affiliate of Supplier
                                       shall be automatically revoked if such Approved Subcontractor ceases to be such
                                       a Supplier Affiliate.
                                (D)    Supplier shall remain responsible for the obligations, services, and functions
                                       performed by its Approved Subcontractors to the same extent as if such
                                       obligations, services, and functions were performed directly by Supplier, and for
                                       purposes of the Agreement, all work performed by Supplier’s Approved
                                       Subcontractors shall be deemed work performed by Supplier. Supplier shall be
                                       Capital One's sole point of contact regarding the Services, including with respect
                                       to payment. Supplier shall not disclose Capital One Confidential Information to an
                                       Approved Subcontractor or otherwise except to the extent permitted under
                                       Section 13.1(C). Supplier shall have appropriate controls in place, including the
                                       performance of audits and monitoring of its Approved Subcontractors’
                                       performance, to ensure full compliance with all of Supplier’s responsibilities under
                                       the Agreement.

                                (D)    Capital One may perform two (2) annual Audits of Supplier without incurring
                                       additional fees. One (1) Audit could consist of a corporate assessment, an
                                       operations assessment, and a data center assessment performed at different
                                       locations at different times. For any subsequent Audits after the initial two (2)
                                       Audits, Capital One shall pay to Supplier an amount equal to $1000.00 per day (or
                                       partial day) plus reimbursement of actual travel expenses incurred for the
                                       additional effort required to support such additional Audits (“Additional Audit Fee”),

                                                 (a)       Any Audit or onsite assessment performed by a regulator of
                                                           Capital One shall not count towards the two annual Audits, and
                                                           Supplier may not invoice Capital One an Additional Audit Fee for
                                                           either (i) such regulatory audit or assessment or (ii) any travel
                                                           expenses incurred for such regulatory audit or assessment;
                                                 (b)       If Supplier adds a service location site or data center after the
                                                           Effective Date, then an assessment performed by Capital One of
                                                           the new service locations shall not count as an Audit.
                       9.2      Audit Follow-up.
                                (A)     Supplier shall make available promptly to Capital One the results of any audit or
                                        inspection conducted by Supplier or its Affiliates (including by internal audit staff or
                                        external auditors), or by inspectors, regulators or other representatives (including
                                        internal and external auditors), relating to Supplier's operating practices and
                                        procedures to the extent relevant to the Services or Capital One. Without limiting
                                        the foregoing, Supplier shall promptly notify Capital One of any audit or inspection
                                        findings (whether identified by an internal or independent review) impacting its
                                        security safeguards.
                                (B)     Following an audit or inspection, Capital One may conduct, or request its external
                                        auditors or examiners to conduct, an exit conference with Supplier to obtain factual
                                        concurrence with issues identified in the review.
                                (C)     Supplier and Capital One shall promptly meet to review each audit or inspection
                                        report after its issuance and to mutually agree upon the appropriate manner, if any,
                                        in which to respond to the changes suggested by the audit or inspection report.
                                        Capital One and Supplier agree to develop operating procedures for the sharing
                                        of audit and regulatory findings and reports related to Supplier's operating
                                        practices and procedures produced by auditors or regulators of either Party.
                                (D)     Supplier shall promptly develop and implement an appropriate action plan to
                                        address and resolve any deficiencies, concerns and/or recommendations
                                        identified in an exit interview or audit or inspection report. Supplier, at its own
                                        expense, shall undertake remedial action in accordance with such exit interview or
                                        action plan and the dates specified therein, including for all actions, to the extent
                                        necessary to comply with Supplier’s obligations under the Agreement.
                       9.3      Records Retention. Unless otherwise directed by Capital One pursuant to other
                                provisions of the Agreement, Supplier shall, until the latest of:
                                (A)     seven (7) years after creation of the record;
                                (B)     all pending matters relating to the Agreement (e.g., disputes) are closed; or
                                (C)     the information is no longer required for either Party to comply with Applicable
                                        Laws or the expiration of any applicable legal “hold order” as to which Capital One
                                        has provided Supplier with written notice,
                                maintain and provide access upon request to the records, documents and other information
                                required to meet Capital One's audit rights under the Agreement. Before destroying or
                                otherwise disposing of such information, Supplier shall provide Capital One with sixty (60)
                                days prior written notice and offer Capital One the opportunity to recover such information
             Capital One Confidential                                 9

DocuSign Envelope ID: F8908CCE-2E91-492F-9EA1-78261F0041C3
                                 or to request Supplier to deliver such information to Capital One, with Capital One paying
                                 Supplier’s out-of-pocket expenses.
                       9.4       Overcharges.
                                 (A)      If as a result of an audit or otherwise it is determined that Supplier has overcharged
                                          Capital One, Supplier shall credit Capital One’s account (or, at Capital One’s
                                          option, pay Capital One directly) an amount equal to the overcharge .
                                 (B)      If an audit discloses that Supplier’s overcharges exceeded five percent (5%) of the
                                          aggregate of charges during the period audited, then Supplier shall also reimburse
                                          Capital One for the reasonable cost of the audit.
             10.       SAVING CLAUSE
                       Capital One's failure to perform its responsibilities set forth in the Agreement (other than as
                       provided in Section 19.1) shall not be grounds for termination by Supplier or suspension of all or
                       any portion of the Services. Supplier's nonperformance of its obligations under the Agreement
                       shall be excused if and to the extent (i) such Supplier nonperformance results from Capital One's
                       failure to perform its responsibilities; and (ii) Supplier provides Capital One with reasonable written
                       notice of such nonperformance, and if requested by Capital One, Supplier uses Commercially
                       Reasonable Efforts to perform notwithstanding Capital One's failure to perform (with Capital One
                       being responsible to reimburse Supplier for its additional out-of-pocket expenses for such efforts).
             11.       CHARGES
                       11.1      General. Supplier shall not charge, and Capital One shall not be required to pay to
                                 Supplier, any amounts for the Services other than or in addition to those payable under the
                                 Agreement and as outlined in the Attachments or SOW.
                       11.2      Expenses. Expenses that Supplier incurs in performing the Services are not separately
                                 reimbursable by Capital One, except as expressly agreed otherwise in a Statement of
                                 Work. Supplier shall retain accurate detailed records of any such expenses reimbursed by
                                 Capital One, which records must be provided to Capital One for review with any request
                                 for reimbursement.
                       11.3      Taxes. The Parties' respective responsibilities for taxes arising under or in connection with
                                 the Agreement shall be as follows:
                                 (A)      Each Party shall be responsible for:
                                          (i)       any personal property taxes on property it uses, regardless of whether
                                                    such property is owned or leased;
                                          (ii)      franchise and privilege taxes on its business;
                                          (iii)     taxes based on its net income or gross receipts; and
                                          (iv)      taxes based on the employment or wages of its employees, including
                                                    FICA, Medicare, unemployment, worker’s compensation and other similar
                                                    taxes such as those imposed by or related to the Affordable Care Act.
                                 (B)      Supplier shall be responsible for any sales, use, goods and services, provincial,
                                          excise, value-added, services, consumption and other taxes and duties payable
                                          by Supplier on the goods or services used or consumed by Supplier in performing
             Capital One Confidential                                  10

DocuSign Envelope ID: F8908CCE-2E91-492F-9EA1-78261F0041C3
                                       the Services where the tax is imposed on Supplier’s acquisition or use of such
                                       goods or services, and the amount of tax is measured by Supplier’s costs in
                                       acquiring such goods or services.
                                (C)    Capital One shall be responsible for any sales, use, goods and services, provincial,
                                       excise, value-added, services, consumption or other tax that is assessed on the
                                       provision of the Services as a whole, or on any particular Service. If and to the
                                       extent such tax is reduced or eliminated during the Term, Supplier shall decrease
                                       its charges for the Services to the same extent as its tax burden is reduced or
                                       eliminated as a result of the reduction or elimination of such tax.
                                (D)    To the extent that Supplier is required by Applicable Laws to collect sales and use
                                       tax and/or goods and services tax from Capital One on the provision of such goods
                                       and/or services and remit such tax to the respective states, provinces and/or
                                       localities, Capital One shall pay such tax to Supplier provided that Supplier
                                       invoices Capital One for such tax on the invoice for such goods and/or services.
                                       Capital One shall not be responsible to Supplier for any sales and use tax and/or
                                       goods and services tax that Supplier fails to collect at the time of the original or
                                       amended invoicing for the goods and/or services. In the case of the issuance of
                                       an amended invoice to Capital One for any goods and/or services, in no event will
                                       Capital One be responsible to Supplier for any sales and use tax and/or goods and
                                       services tax invoiced by Supplier to Capital One more than three (3) years from
                                       the date of the provision of such goods and/or services. In addition, Supplier shall
                                       notify Capital One at the commencement of the Agreement of the charges upon
                                       which it intends to charge Capital One sales and use tax and/or goods and services
                                       tax and the applicable taxing jurisdictions for which it will be collecting and remitting
                                       such tax.
                                (E)    If a sales, use, goods and services, provincial, excise, value-added, services,
                                       consumption, or other tax is assessed on the provision of any portion of the
                                       Services, the Parties shall work together to segregate the payments under the
                                       Agreement into three (3) payment streams:
                                       (i)       those for taxable Services;
                                       (ii)      those for which Supplier functions merely as a payment agent for Capital
                                                 One in receiving goods, supplies, or services (including leasing and
                                                 licensing arrangements) that otherwise are non-taxable or have previously
                                                 been subject to tax; and
                                       (iii)     those for other nontaxable Services.
                                (F)    The Parties shall cooperate with each other to enable each to more accurately
                                       determine its own tax liability and to minimize such liability to the maximum extent
                                       legally permissible. Unless Capital One has provided Supplier with tax-exemption,
                                       direct pay, or resale certificates, Supplier's invoices shall separately state the
                                       amounts of any taxes Supplier is collecting from Capital One, and Supplier shall
                                       remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities. Each Party shall provide and make
                                       available to the other any direct pay or resale certificates, information regarding
                                       out-of-state or out-of-country sales or use of equipment, materials, or services, and
                                       other exemption certificates or information reasonably requested by the other
                                       Party.
                                (G)    Supplier shall promptly notify Capital One of, and coordinate with Capital One the
                                       response to, and settlement of, any claim for taxes asserted by applicable taxing
                                       authorities for which Capital One is responsible hereunder. In such event, and if
             Capital One Confidential                              11

                                        the claim arises out of a form or return signed by Supplier, then Supplier may elect
                                        to control the response to and settlement of the claim, but Capital One shall have
                                        all rights to participate in the responses and settlements that are appropriate to its
                                        potential responsibilities or liabilities. If Supplier fails to timely notify Capital One
                                        or to allow Capital One to participate in responses and settlements of a claim for
                                        taxes as provided above, then Capital One shall have no liability to Supplier for
                                        any applicable taxes or penalties that result from such claim. If Capital One
                                        requests Supplier to challenge the imposition of any tax, Supplier shall do so in a
                                        timely manner, and Capital One shall reimburse Supplier for the reasonable legal
                                        fees and expenses it incurs. Capital One shall be entitled to any tax refunds or
                                        rebates granted to the extent such refunds or rebates are of taxes that were paid
                                        by Capital One.
                                (H)     Capital One shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment to or for the
                                        account of Supplier pursuant to the Agreement any amounts that are required to
                                        be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under any applicable
                                        federal, state, local or foreign law, and shall promptly remit such amounts to the
                                        appropriate taxing authority. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over,
                                        such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of the Agreement as having been
                                        paid to Supplier. Capital One shall furnish to Supplier the original or certified copy
                                        of a receipt evidencing payment, or other evidence of payment reasonably
                                        acceptable to Supplier.
             12.        INVOICING AND PAYMENT
                       12.1     Invoicing.
                                (A)     In order to facilitate invoicing and payment for the Services, each SOW or
                                        Schedule shall be accompanied by a Capital One Purchase Order ("P.O.") issued
                                        by Capital One and accessible by Supplier via an online portal maintained by
                                        Capital One’s third party facilitator (currently Coupa™ but subject to change by
                                        Capital One upon notice) using login information provided by Capital One or
                                        Capital One’s third party facilitator. Any failure to issue such a P.O., however, will
                                        not relieve Capital One of its payment obligations under an SOW or Schedule. For
                                        the avoidance of doubt, the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall take
                                        precedence over the pre-printed terms and conditions on any P.O.
                                (B)     Supplier shall invoice Capital One for all amounts due under the Agreement on a
                                        monthly basis, in arrears, within thirty (30) days after the end of each month.
                                        Supplier shall submit invoices showing such details as reasonably specified by
                                        Capital One and, unless otherwise directed by Capital One, using the online portal.
                                (C)     Each invoice shall be complete as to the charges for such billing cycle. If an invoice
                                        states that certain charges cannot be determined as of the date of the invoice,
                                        such charges may be added to a later invoice, but in no case later than sixty (60)
                                        days past the end of the original billing cycle.
                                (D)     Unless otherwise specified in a Statement of Work, charges for all Services shall
                                        be invoiced and paid in U.S. Dollars.
                       12.2     Payment Due.
                                (A)     Subject to the other provisions of this Article 12, undisputed invoices provided for
                                        under Section 12.1 and properly submitted to Capital One pursuant to the

                                (B)      Capital One shall make payments to Supplier by, at Capital One’s option, wire
                                         transfer, ACH transfer or check. Capital One shall make all payments directly to
                                         Supplier, not to third parties (other than to Supplier’s account with a reputable
                                         bank).
                                (C)      Time is of the essence in all payment terms. Excluding amounts disputed in good
                                         faith, any amounts not paid to Supplier when due shall bear interest at the rate of
                                         one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum legal rate if less,
                                         commencing with the payment due date. Capital One shall reimburse Supplier for
                                         all costs of collection with respect to unpaid amounts rightfully due to Supplier,
                                         including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
                       12.3     Proration. Except as may be otherwise provided in the Agreement, Supplier shall compute
                                periodic charges (if any) under the Agreement on a calendar month basis and prorate same
                                for any partial month.
                       12.4     Deductions With respect to any amount to be paid by Capital One hereunder, Capital One
                                may deduct from such amount any amount that Supplier is obligated to pay Capital One
                                and the Parties mutually agree that Supplier is obligated to pay. Disputed Charges. In
                                addition to its rights under Section 12.4, Capital One shall have the right to withhold

                                reasonably disputes in good faith, including as not conforming to the requirements of this
                                Article 12, but only until such time as the charges are re-submitted in accordance with such
                                requirements or such dispute is otherwise resolved. In addition, Capital One shall not be
                                liable for payment of charges for any nonconforming Services or Services performed after
                                termination of an SOW or the Agreement.

                                                Personnel to the extent necessary to carry out the specific purposes for

                                                minimize the impact of the Confidential Information Violation and any
                                                Losses resulting therefrom.
                                       (vi)     With respect to Confidential Information that is Personally Identifiable
                                                Information, the terms of this Section 13.1(B) shall not supersede any
                                                different, or similar but more protective, rights or obligations set forth in
                                                Section 13.2.
                                (C)    Exclusions.
                                       (i)      Section 13.1(B) shall not apply to any particular information (other than
                                                Personally Identifiable Information) which Supplier or Capital One can
                                                demonstrate: (a) was, at the time of disclosure to it, in the public domain;
                                                (b) after disclosure to it, is published or otherwise becomes part of the
                                                public domain through no fault of the receiving Party; (c) was lawfully in
                                                the possession of the receiving Party at the time of disclosure to it without
                                                obligation of confidentiality; (d) was received after disclosure to it from a
                                                third party who had a lawful right to disclose such information to it without
                                                any obligation to restrict its further use or disclosure; (e) was
                                                independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to

                                                satisfy any legal requirement of a competent government body.
                                       (ii)     Supplier may disclose Capital One Confidential Information (including
                                                Personally Identifiable Information) to Affiliates of Supplier and to
                                                Approved Subcontractors; provided, however, that: (a) such disclosure is
                                                only to the extent and for the duration necessary for Supplier to perform
                                                its obligations under the Agreement; and (b) such Affiliate or Approved
                                                Subcontractor is bound to comply with the same obligations to which
                                                Supplier is subject under the Agreement with respect to Confidential
                                                Information (including as provided in this Article 13).
                                       (iii)    Capital One may disclose Supplier Confidential Information to Affiliates of
                                                Capital One if and to the extent necessary for Capital One and its Affiliates
                                                to exercise their respective rights or to comply with their respective
                                                obligations under the Agreement. Capital One may disclose Supplier
                                                Confidential Information to third party service providers of Capital One and
                                                its Affiliates if and to the extent necessary for Capital One and its Affiliates
                                                to exercise their respective rights or to comply with their respective
                                                obligations under the Agreement, and provided that such third party
                                                service providers are bound by confidentiality obligations to Capital One
                                                substantially as protective as those described herein.
                                (D)    Ownership; License. Each Party’s Confidential Information shall remain the
                                       property of that Party. Nothing contained in this Section 13.1 shall be construed
                                       as obligating a Party to disclose its Confidential Information to the other Party, or
                                       as granting to or conferring on a Party, expressly or impliedly, any rights or license
                                       to the Confidential Information of the other Party, and any such obligation or grant
                                       shall only be as provided by other provisions of the Agreement.
                                (E)    Remedies. Each Party agrees that because of the unique nature of such
                                       Confidential Information, any breach of this Article 13 would cause the other Party
                                       irreparable harm, and money damages and other remedies available at law in the
                                       event of a breach would not be adequate to compensate the other Party for any
             Capital One Confidential                                15

DocuSign Envelope ID: F8908CCE-2E91-492F-9EA1-78261F0041C3
                                       such breach. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party shall be entitled,
                                       without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief,
                                       including injunctive relief and specific performance, as a remedy for any such
                                       breach. Such relief shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all other remedies
                                       available to the other Party, whether under the Agreement, at law or in equity.
                       13.2     Safeguarding of Information.
                                (A)    Supplier acknowledges that Capital One is subject to the GLB Act, Title V, pursuant
                                       to which Capital One obtains certain undertakings from Supplier with regard to the
                                       privacy, use and protection of Personally Identifiable Information. Therefore,
                                       notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement and in
                                       addition to (and not in substitution for) Supplier’s other obligations hereunder:
                                       (i)      Supplier shall protect and keep confidential all Personally Identifiable
                                                Information. During the Term, Supplier shall collect, maintain or use
                                                Personally Identifiable Information only to the extent necessary to perform
                                                the obligations under the Agreement and for which such Personally
                                                Identifiable Information was disclosed to or obtained by Supplier.
                                       (ii)     Supplier shall ensure that Supplier Personnel shall not attempt to access,
                                                or allow access to, any Personally Identifiable Information that they are not
                                                permitted to access in connection with the provision of Services under the
                                                Agreement.
                                       (iii)    Supplier represents and warrants that it has, and warrants and covenants
                                                that for so long as it retains Personally Identifiable Information it will
                                                continue to have, adequate administrative, technical, and physical
                                                safeguards to (a) ensure the security and confidentiality of such Personally
                                                Identifiable Information; (b) protect against any anticipated or reasonably
                                                likely threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such Personally
                                                Identifiable Information; (c) protect against unauthorized access to or use
                                                of such Personally Identifiable Information; (d) ensure the proper disposal
                                                of Personally Identifiable Information; and (e) without limiting the
                                                generality of items (a) through (d) preceding, comply with the requirements
                                                contained in Section 501(b) of the GLB Act and the Interagency Guidelines

                                                Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In
                                                addition to the foregoing, Supplier represents and warrants that the
                                                manner in which it performs its obligations hereunder (including the
                                                manner in which it maintains, stores, backs up, transports, transmits or
                                                otherwise uses Personally Identifiable Information) will comply with any
                                                applicable state data security requirements covering information that, in
                                                whole or in part, is made up of Personally Identifiable Information,
                                                including, 201 CMR 17.00 et seq., ("Standards for the Protection of
                                                Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth").
                                       (iv)     Supplier shall immediately notify Capital One if (a) Supplier discovers
                                                there (1) has been a material breach, or unauthorized intrusion or access,
                                                or (2) is a potentially material vulnerability, in each case, in the security
                                                safeguards required by this Section 13.2, including the security
                                                safeguards protecting Personally Identifiable Information in the

                                                of authorized access to Personally Identifiable Information by Supplier
                                                Personnel) (each of the foregoing, a "Security Incident"). Such notification
                                                shall include the date and time of the Security Incident, what (if any)
                                                corrective action has been taken by Supplier, what steps Supplier has
                                                taken to isolate the Security Incident, and any additional details that may
                                                be necessary for Capital One to isolate the Security Incident or prevent
                                                any further adverse effect of the Security Incident. Supplier shall promptly
                                                provide Capital One with any additional information that Capital One may
                                                request (e.g., for access logs), and promptly comply with any reasonable
                                                requests that Capital One may make (e.g., changing security credentials),
                                                in each case, relating to the Security Incident. Supplier shall continue to
                                                promptly inform Capital One of any proposed corrective action that it plans
                                                to take with respect to the Security Incident and shall promptly take all
                                                corrective actions that are reasonably necessary to isolate the Security
                                                Incident and prevent further adverse effects. Upon receipt of notice of a
                                                Security Incident, Capital One may take all reasonable and appropriate
                                                steps to (aa) protect Personally Identifiable Information, (bb) execute its
                                                obligations under state or federal Security Incident requirements and (cc)

                                                Information. Supplier represents that it may, can and will, following a
                                                Security Incident, cooperate with Capital One’s efforts to expeditiously
                                                implement its data security breach response program. With respect to a
                                                Security Incident, Supplier shall not communicate with any third party

                                                Security Incident) regarding such Security Incident by making any direct
                                                or indirect reference to either the Services, or any data accessed,
                                                processed or stored on behalf of Capital One, in each case, without the
                                                prior written consent of Capital One; provided, however, any disclosure
                                                that may be required to meet legal or regulatory requirements shall be
                                                subject to Section 21.10(B). While it is the intention of the Parties that
                                                Capital One run its response program remotely, the Parties recognize that
                                                will not always be possible. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Security
                                                Incident" as used herein shall include any data security event triggering
                                                response obligations under the Interagency Guidance on Response

                                                state laws relating to data security breaches, including state law relating
                                                to the unauthorized access to or use of "personal information" or other
                                                similar terms.
                                       (v)      Supplier and its Approved Subcontractors shall not retain Personally
                                                Identifiable Information unless the retention is specifically provided for in
                                                the Agreement, Supplier has a specific business purpose to retain it that
                                                is set forth in the Agreement, and the retention of such data is consistent
                                                with Applicable Laws. At Capital One’s discretion, Supplier shall destroy
                                                such Personally Identifiable Information or return it to Capital One, either
                                                of which shall be performed pursuant to Capital One’s reasonable
                                                instructions: (i) during the Term promptly following the time at which such

                                                   Services, or (ii) within sixty (60) days after termination or expiration of the
                                                   Agreement.
                       13.3     Safeguarding Capital One Data.
                                (A)       As between the Parties, Capital One (and its Affiliates) are the sole and exclusive
                                          owners of the Capital One Data. If Supplier obtains any rights in Capital One Data,
                                          except any use rights conveyed herein, Supplier will assign those rights to Capital
                                          One. Supplier will not withhold any Capital One Data as a means of resolving a
                                          dispute. During the Term, Supplier shall use Capital One Data solely as necessary
                                          to perform its obligations under the Agreement. Except as explicitly set forth in this
                                          Agreement, Supplier shall not use, access, store, share or disclose to any third
                                          party, Capital One Data. Supplier shall not re-create or reverse engineer any
                                          Capital One Data or sell any product or service using Capital One Data.
                                (B)       Supplier shall establish and maintain safeguards against the destruction, loss or
                                          alteration of Capital One Data in the possession or control of Supplier which are
                                          no less rigorous than those maintained by Capital One as of the Effective Date and
                                          which are no less rigorous than those maintained by Supplier for its other
                                          customers’ information of a similar nature. Capital One may establish backup
                                          security for Capital One Data and to keep backup Capital One Data and Capital
                                          One Data files in its possession if it chooses.
                                (C)       Without limiting the generality of Section 13.3(A):
                                          (i)      Supplier Personnel shall not attempt to access, or allow access to, any
                                                   Capital One Data that they are not permitted to access under this
                                                   Agreement. If such access is attained (or is reasonably suspected),
                                                   Supplier shall immediately report such incident to Capital One, describe in
                                                   detail the accessed Capital One Data, and if applicable return to Capital
                                                   One any copied or removed Capital One Data.
                                          (ii)     Supplier shall implement and maintain security systems and procedures,
                                                   including thorough systems security measures, to guard against the
                                                   unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of Software and Capital
                                                   One Data. Such measures shall include the use of Software which:
                                                   (A) requires all users to enter a user identification and password prior to
                                                   gaining access to the information systems; (B) controls and tracks the
                                                   addition and deletion of users; and (C) controls and tracks user access to
                                                   areas and features of the information systems.
                                (D)       The obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall survive termination of the
                                          Agreement.
                                In addition to and without limiting the obligations set forth in this Article 13, Supplier shall
                                comply with the requirements set forth in Schedule A, “Information Assurance Third Party
                                Management (“IA TPM”) Contract Requirements”.
             14.       COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND POLICIES
                       14.1     Compliance Generally. Each Party shall perform its obligations in a manner that complies
                                with all Applicable Laws as and to the extent such laws apply or relate to each Party, the
                                provision or use of the Services, or any other act, activity or responsibility of such Party
                                hereunder. This requirement includes identifying and procuring required permits,
                                certificates, approvals and inspections. In addition, Supplier shall maintain commercially

                                reasonable policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with its legal and
                                contractual obligations. Supplier shall maintain evidence of its compliance with Applicable
                                Laws. If a charge of non-compliance with any Applicable Laws occurs, the Party so
                                charged shall promptly notify the other Party of such charge. Supplier shall reasonably
                                cooperate with Capital One with respect to Capital One's efforts to comply with Applicable
                                Laws, including implementing such measures as Capital One deems necessary or
                                appropriate to effect such compliance.
                       14.2      Compliance with Certain Applicable Laws and Policies. Without limiting the generality
                                of Section 14.1:
                                (A)     To the extent applicable to the Services and/or Supplier, Supplier is knowledgeable
                                        about the economic or trade sanctions or restrictions administered by the U.S.
                                        Government (including all Executive Orders and implementing regulations), such
                                        as those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign
                                        Assets Control (“OFAC”) and will ensure that the Services are provided in a
                                        manner consistent with those sanctions and/or restrictions.
                                (B)     Supplier shall not assign to perform the Services any persons or entities identified
                                        on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. So as to
                                        facilitate possible OFAC checks by Capital One, Supplier, no more than fifteen (15)
                                        days prior to assignment to the Services, shall identify to Capital One the names,
                                        addresses and other identifying information of all Supplier Personnel that Supplier
                                        intends to assign to perform the Services.
                                (C)     To the extent applicable to the Services, Supplier is and shall continue to remain
                                        knowledgeable about, and shall remain in full compliance with, all anti-money
                                        laundering requirements and legal obligations regarding combating terrorist
                                        financing contained in the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and all
                                        implementing regulations. Supplier shall perform the Services in full compliance
                                        with such laws, including the performance of any procedures identified in any
                                        Statements of Work. Supplier has, and shall continue to implement, effective
                                        oversight and monitoring procedures to detect and investigate misuse or
                                        misappropriation of any Capital One assets, systems, funds or information by
                                        Supplier Personnel. Supplier shall promptly (not to exceed three (3) Business
                                        Days following discovery) report any such misuse or misappropriation to Capital
                                        One.
                                (D)     Supplier shall comply with all Applicable Laws protecting the confidential material,
                                        information and privacy rights of Capital One, its Affiliates and/or their customers
                                        and consumers, including Title V, Subtitle A of the GLB Act and the Economic
                                        Espionage Act, 18 USC §1831 et. seq.).
                                (E)     The Parties acknowledge that certain items, including computers, electronic
                                        components, telecommunications equipment, software and technical data, which
                                        may be provided hereunder, and certain transactions which may be undertaken
                                        hereunder, may be subject to export controls under Applicable Laws. Supplier
                                        agrees that it shall not export or re-export any such items or any direct product
                                        thereof or undertake any transaction in violation of any such export controls.
                                        Without limiting the generality of Article 14, to the extent within Supplier's control,
                                        Supplier shall be responsible for, and shall coordinate and oversee, compliance
                                        with such Applicable Laws in respect of such items exported, re-exported, trans-
                                        shipped or imported hereunder. As provided in this Section, Supplier shall
                                        reasonably cooperate with Capital One with respect to Capital One's efforts to
                                        comply with any such Applicable Laws, including implementing such export control
                                        measures as Capital One deems necessary to effect such compliance. Supplier

                       14.3        Anti-Bribery and Anticorruption.
                                (A)       Supplier (and its officers, directors and employees, and any third parties acting on
                                          Supplier’s behalf, at its direction or under its control in connection with the
                                          Services), and the Services being directly or indirectly provided by Supplier, shall
                                          comply with all Applicable Laws prohibiting bribery and corruption, including: (i)

                                          Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and (iv) the anti-bribery and
                                          anticorruption laws of any country outside of the United States from which the
                                          Supplier will perform the Services (collectively, the “ABAC Laws”).
                                (B)       Neither Supplier nor any of its officers, directors, employees, or any third parties
                                          acting on Supplier’s behalf, at its direction or under its control in connection with

                                          promised or provided anything of value to any person in order to improperly
                                          influence them in the performance of their legal or contractual duties in connection
                                          with Supplier’s provision of the Services, nor will they do so during the performance

                                of their ability to do the job, not on the basis of their personal characteristics. Supplier shall
                                not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color,

                                         the requisite corporate action on the part of such Party and will not constitute a

                                         default under any material contract by which the Party or any of its material assets
                                         are bound, or an event that would, with notice or lapse of time or both, constitute

                                       completion of the Term, or it shall allow for reporting of claims until the later of two
                                       (2) years after the Term or the period of the applicable limitations of actions has

                                       regarding the event.

                                        be entitled to have sole control over the defense and settlement of such claim;

                                        such claim; and (ii) the indemnitor shall obtain the prior written approval of the
                                        indemnitee before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend
                                        against such claim.
                                (C)     Procedure When No Notice of Election Is Delivered. If the indemnitor does not
                                        deliver a Notice of Election relating to a claim, or otherwise fails to acknowledge
                                        its indemnification obligation or to assume the defense of a claim, within the
                                        required notice period or fails to diligently defend the claim, the indemnitee may
                                        defend the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate, at the cost, expense,
                                        and risk of the indemnitor, including payment of any judgment or award and the
                                        costs of settlement or compromise of the claim.
                       17.5     Infringement Remedies. If any Work used by Supplier to provide the Services or included
                                in the Services becomes, or in Supplier's reasonable opinion is likely to become, the
                                subject of an infringement or misappropriation claim or proceeding, in addition to
                                indemnifying Capital One as provided in this Article 17 and to the other rights Capital One
                                may have under the Agreement, Supplier shall:

                                (A)       promptly secure the right at Supplier's expense to continue using the Work, or
                                (B)       if this cannot be accomplished with Commercially Reasonable Efforts, then at
                                          Supplier’s expense, replace or modify the Work to make it non-infringing or without
                                          misappropriation, provided that any such replacement or modification will not
                                          degrade the performance or quality of the affected component of the Services, or
                                (C)       if neither of the foregoing can be accomplished by Supplier with Commercially
                                          Reasonable Efforts, and only in such event, remove the Work from the Services,
                                          in which case the charges shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such removal (and
                                          if in Capital One’s reasonable opinion such removal is material to all or any portion
                                          of the remaining Services, Capital One may terminate such portion of the affected
                                          Services or the entire Agreement, as the case may be, without liability).
             18.       LIABILITY AND DAMAGES
                       18.1     Liability for Losses. In addition to any rights and remedies set forth elsewhere in the
                                Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Party shall be
                                liable to the other and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and
                                assigns, for any and all Losses and threatened Losses arising from, or in connection with,
                                that Party's failure to comply with any obligation, covenant, warranty, affirmation, or
                                requirement set forth in the Agreement or required by law. Demands pursuant to this
                                Section may be made in writing by the Party seeking to be made whole pursuant to this
                                Section. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit or otherwise modify any remedy
                                otherwise available at law, in equity or under the Agreement.
                       18.2     Limitation and Measure of Damages.
                                (A)       SUBJECT TO SECTION 18.2(C), AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO
                                          THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT, WHETHER IN
                                          CONTRACT OR IN TORT (INCLUDING BREACH OF WARRANTY,
                                          NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT), OR OTHERWISE, SHALL A
                                          PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR ANYONE CLAIMING UNDER
                                          OR THROUGH THE OTHER PARTY) FOR INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL,
                                          EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF,
                                          RESULTING FROM, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE
                                          PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF THE AGREEMENT, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY
                                          HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN
                                          ADVANCE. THE FOREGOING WILL NOT BE DEEMED TO APPLY TO SERVICE
                                          LEVEL CREDITS.
                                (B)       Subject to Section 18.2(C), each Party's total liability to the other, whether in
                                          contract or in tort (including breach of warranty, negligence and strict liability in
                                          tort) or otherwise arising out of, resulting from, or in any way connected with, the
                                          performance or breach of the Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to
                                          total charges payable to Supplier pursuant to all Statements of Work under the
                                          Agreement for the month in which the most recent event giving rise to liability
                                          occurred plus the eleven (11) months prior thereto; provided, however, that if such
                                          event giving rise to liability occurs during the first twelve (12) months after any
                                          SOW Effective Date, the foregoing amount shall include a prorated amount for
                                          each month less than twelve (12) based upon the average of the monthly charges
                                          actually paid for that SOW.
                                (C)       The limitations set forth in Sections 18.2(A) and 18.2(B) shall not apply with respect
                                          to any of the following: (i) damages occasioned by the willful misconduct, fraud or
                                          gross negligence of Supplier; (ii) claims that are the subject of indemnification

                                         pursuant to Article 17; (iii) damages occasioned by a Party's breach of its
                                         obligations with respect to Confidential Information as set forth in Article 13; (iv)
                                         damages occasioned by improper or wrongful termination of the Agreement or
                                         abandonment of the work by Supplier.
                                (D)      Damages. Without limiting the scope of that which may constitute direct damages
                                         under Applicable Laws, the following shall be considered direct damages and shall
                                         not be considered consequential damages to the extent they result from a Party's
                                         failure to fulfill its obligations in accordance with the Agreement: (A) costs and
                                         expenses of recreating or reloading any of Capital One's information that is lost or
                                         damaged; (B) costs and expenses of implementing a workaround in respect of a
                                         failure to provide the Services; (C) costs and expenses of replacing lost or
                                         damaged equipment and software and materials; (D) costs and expenses incurred
                                         to correct errors in software maintenance and enhancements provided as part of
                                         the Services; (E) costs and expenses incurred to procure the Services from an
                                         alternate source; (F) costs and expenses incurred to resolve claims by Capital
                                         One’s customers; and (G) time, overtime, or related expenses incurred by Capital
                                         One or its Affiliates, including overhead allocations for employees, wages and
                                         salaries of additional personnel, travel expenses, telecommunication and similar
                                         charges incurred due to the failure of Supplier to provide the Services or incurred
                                         in connection with (A) through (F) above.
             19.       TERMINATION
                       19.1     Termination for Cause.
                                (A)      If Supplier:
                                         (i)      commits a material breach of the Agreement that is not cured within
                                                  thirty (30) days after notice of breach from Capital One to Supplier;
                                         (ii)     breaches its obligations under Section 13.1 ("Confidentiality"),
                                                  Section 13.2 ("Safeguarding of Information") Section 13.3 (“Safeguarding
                                                  Capital One Data”; or
                                         (iii)    fails to comply with any Applicable Laws;
                                         then Capital One may, by giving notice to Supplier, terminate the Master Services
                                         Agreement and part or all of any or all Statements of Work, effective on the date
                                         specified in the notice of termination, without liability as of that date. Any
                                         termination by Capital One for breach shall be without prejudice as to Capital One’s
                                         other rights resulting therefrom.
                                (B)      If Capital One fails to pay Supplier when due undisputed charges totaling at least
                                         two (2) month's portion of such charges under a Statement of Work and fails to
                                         make such payment within thirty (30) days after written notice from Supplier of the
                                         failure to make such payment, Supplier may, by giving written notice to Capital
                                         One, terminate the Statement of Work as of a date specified in the notice of
                                         termination which is at least thirty (30) days thereafter.
                       19.2     Termination for Convenience. Capital One may terminate the Master Services
                                Agreement and part or all of any or all Statements of Work for convenience and without
                                cause at any time by giving Supplier ninety (90) days advance notice designating the
                                termination date. In such event Capital One shall be liable to pay to Supplier the charges
                                for the terminated Services performed up to the date of termination and any expenses that
             Capital One Confidential                                  28

DocuSign Envelope ID: F8908CCE-2E91-492F-9EA1-78261F0041C3
                                Capital One would otherwise owe Supplier incurred by Supplier to provide the contracted
                                services. If a purported termination for cause by Capital One under Section 19.1 is
                                ultimately determined not to have been properly a termination for cause, then such
                                termination by Capital One shall instead be deemed to be a termination for convenience
                                under this Section 19.2.
                       19.3     Termination upon Change of Control.
                                (A)      Change of Control of Supplier. If (i) another entity, directly or indirectly, in a single
                                         transaction or series of related transactions, acquires either control of Supplier or
                                         all or substantially all of the assets of Supplier, or (ii) Supplier is merged with or
                                         into another entity, then Capital One may terminate the Master Services
                                         Agreement and part or all of any or all Statements of Work without liability, by
                                         giving Supplier written notice designating a date at a minimum one hundred and
                                         eighty (180) days in advance upon which such termination shall be effective.
                                (B)      Change of Control of Capital One. If (i) another entity, directly or indirectly, in a
                                         single transaction or series of related transactions, acquires control of Capital One
                                         or its parent Capital One Financial Corporation ("COFC") or all or substantially all
                                         of the assets of Capital One or COFC; (ii) COFC is merged with or into another
                                         entity; or (iii) in a single transaction or series of related transactions, COFC
                                         acquires control of an entity that is substantially similar in size to COFC, then
                                         Capital One may terminate the Master Services Agreement and part or all of any
                                         or all Statements of Work without liability, by giving Supplier written notice
                                         designating a date at a minimum thirty (30) days in advance upon which such
                                         termination shall be effective.
                       19.4     Termination for Regulatory Objection. In the event that any governmental regulator
                                having jurisdiction over Capital One or its Affiliates or any of their activities objects to the
                                Agreement or any aspect of Supplier’s provision of the Services hereunder, Capital One
                                may terminate the Master Services Agreement and part or all of any or all Statements of
                                Work without liability, upon written notice to Supplier.
                       19.5     Extension of Termination/Expiration Effective Date. Capital One may extend the
                                effective date of any termination/expiration of the Master Services Agreement or any
                                Statement of Work one or more times as it elects in its discretion, provided that the total of
                                all such extensions shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days after the original
                                effective date of such termination/expiration. For any notice or notices of such extensions
                                provided to Supplier less than thirty (30) days before the then-scheduled date of
                                termination/expiration, Capital One shall also reimburse Supplier for additional out-of-
                                pocket expenses caused by such notices not having been delivered thirty (30) days or
                                more before the then scheduled date of termination/expiration.

                                        other provisions of the Agreement. Charges for such activities by Supplier shall

             20.       DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                       Any dispute between the Parties arising out of or relating to the Agreement, including with respect
                       to the interpretation of any provision of the Agreement and with respect to the performance by
                       Supplier or Capital One, shall be resolved as provided in this Article 20
                       20.1     Informal Dispute Resolution.
                                (A)     Subject to Section (B), the Parties initially shall attempt to resolve their dispute
                                        informally, in accordance with the following:
                                        (i)      Upon the notice by a Party to the other Party of a dispute ("Dispute Date"),
                                                 each Party shall appoint a designated representative who does not devote
                                                 substantially all of his or her time to performance under the Agreement,
                                                 whose task it will be to meet for the purpose of endeavoring to resolve
                                                 such dispute.
                                        (ii)     The designated representatives shall meet as often as the Parties
                                                 reasonably deem necessary in order to gather and furnish to the other all
                                                 information with respect to the matter in issue which the Parties believe to
                                                 be appropriate and germane in connection with its resolution. The
                                                 representatives shall discuss the problem and attempt to resolve the
                                                 dispute without the necessity of any formal proceeding.
                                        (iii)    During the course of discussion, all reasonable requests made by a Party
                                                 to the other for non-legally privileged information reasonably related to the
                                                 Agreement shall be honored in order that a Party may be fully advised of
                                                 the other's position.
                                        (iv)     The specific format for the discussions shall be left to the discretion of the
                                                 designated representatives.
                                (B)     Formal proceedings for the resolution of a dispute may be commenced by either
                                        Party only upon the earlier to occur of any of the following:
                                        (i)      the representatives designated in Section (A) mutually conclude that
                                                 amicable resolution through continued negotiation of the matter does not
                                                 appear likely;

                                         (ii)     thirty (30) days after the Dispute Date (this period shall be deemed to run
                                                  notwithstanding any claim that the process described in this Section 20.1
                                                  was not followed or completed); or
                                         (iii)    commencement of litigation is permissible pursuant to Section 20.3.
                       20.2     Arbitration. If either Party elects to commence formal dispute resolution pursuant to
                                Section (B)(i) or Section (B)(ii), then such dispute shall be administered by the American
                                Arbitration Association ("AAA") and must be submitted to mandatory and binding arbitration
                                in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA by the electing Party (the
                                "Disputing Party") pursuant to the following conditions:
                                (A)      Selection of Arbitrator. The Disputing Party shall notify AAA (the dispute resolution
                                         entity, or "DR") and the other Party in writing describing in reasonable detail the
                                         nature of the dispute, and shall request that DR furnish a list of five (5) possible
                                         arbitrators who shall have substantial experience in the area of information
                                         technology. Each Party shall have fifteen (15) days to reject two (2) of the
                                         proposed arbitrators. If only one individual has not been so rejected, he or she
                                         shall serve as arbitrator; if two or more individuals have not been so rejected, DR
                                         shall select the arbitrator from those individuals.
                                (B)      Conduct of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
                                         then-effective rules of the DR (the "DR Rules"), provided that to the extent this
                                         Section 20.2 modifies, supplements or is inconsistent with the DR Rules, this
                                         Section 20.2 will govern. The arbitrator shall allow reasonable discovery in the
                                         forms permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent consistent
                                         with the purpose of the arbitration. The arbitrator shall have no power or authority
                                         to amend or disregard any provision of this Section 20.2 or any other provision of
                                         the Agreement (in particular, the arbitrator shall not have the authority to exclude
                                         the right of a Party to terminate the Agreement when a Party would otherwise have
                                         such right). The arbitration hearing shall be commenced promptly and conducted
                                         expeditiously, with each of Capital One and Supplier being allocated one-half of
                                         the time for the presentation of its case. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties,
                                         an arbitration hearing shall be conducted on consecutive days, and will last as long
                                         as necessary to allow for a full and fair hearing.
                                (C)      Findings and Conclusions. The arbitrator shall, at the time of rendering a judgment
                                         and award, prepare and distribute to the Parties an opinion describing the bases
                                         for such judgment and award and containing an opinion setting forth the reasons
                                         for the giving or denial of any award. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and
                                         binding on the Parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of
                                         competent jurisdiction. The Parties shall share equally the charges of DR. The
                                         arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing
                                         Party to the extent permitted under Applicable Law and as warranted under the
                                         circumstances. The arbitrator may also award indirect or consequential,
                                         exemplary, punitive or special damages in accordance with the terms of the
                                         Agreement.
                                (D)      Place of Arbitration Hearings. Arbitration hearings hereunder shall be held in or
                                         near McLean, Virginia. If Supplier and Capital One agree, arbitration hearings may
                                         be held in another location.
                                (E)      Time is of the Essence. The arbitrator is instructed that time is of the essence in
                                         the arbitration proceeding, and that the arbitrator shall have the right and authority
                                         to issue monetary sanctions against either of the Parties if, upon a showing of good
                                         cause, that Party is unreasonably delaying the proceeding. The arbitrator shall

                                         render his or her judgment or award promptly following the conclusion of the
                                         hearing. Recognizing the express desire of the Parties for an expeditious means
                                         of dispute resolution, the arbitrator shall limit or allow the Parties to expand the
                                         scope of discovery as may be reasonable under the circumstances.
                       20.3     Litigation.
                                (A)      A Party may avoid arbitration as required in Section 20.2 and may initiate litigation
                                         only if: (x) the dispute relate to a Party's breach of its obligations under Articles
                                         6(Proprietary Rights), 9 (Audits; Records Retention), 13 (Confidentiality;
                                         Safeguarding of Information) and 14 (Compliance with Laws and Policies), or
                                         Section 19.6 (Termination/Expiration Assistance); (y) such action is necessary to
                                         avoid the expiration of an applicable limitations period or to preserve a superior
                                         position with respect to other creditors, or (z) a Party makes a good faith
                                         determination that a breach of the Agreement by the other Party is such that a
                                         temporary restraining order or other injunctive relief is necessary in order to avoid
                                         irreparable injury that cannot be addressed by an action at law, including as
                                         follows:
                                         (i)      Each of the Parties acknowledges that the other Party would be irreparably
                                                  injured and damages at law would not be adequate compensation for such
                                                  injury if any of the provisions of Articles 6, 9, 13, and 14 or of Section 19.6
                                                  were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
                                                  otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Party seeking to enforce such
                                                  provisions against the breaching Party shall be entitled to seek and obtain
                                                  injunctive relief, without posting bond or proving damages, and in addition
                                                  to all other remedies, and the breaching Party shall not oppose the entry
                                                  of an appropriate order restraining any such breach of its obligations under
                                                  such provisions, compelling performance by such Party of its obligations
                                                  under such provisions, or restraining such Party from any further breaches
                                                  (or attempted or threatened breaches) of its obligations under such
                                                  provisions.
                                         (ii)     Supplier acknowledges that if Supplier breaches Supplier's obligations in
                                                  Section 20.4, Capital One would be irreparably injured and damages at
                                                  law would not be adequate compensation for such injury. Accordingly,
                                                  Capital One shall be entitled to seek and obtain injunctive relief, without
                                                  posting bond or proving damages, and in addition to all other remedies,
                                                  and Supplier shall not oppose the entry of an appropriate order restraining
                                                  any such breach by Supplier, compelling performance by Supplier of its

                                          or state courts located within Henrico County or Fairfax County, Virginia (or an
                                          appellate court issuing the same on appeal therefrom). The Parties further consent
                                          to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court located within a district that
                                          encompasses assets or receivables of a Party against which a judgment has been

                                          such Party. Each Party waives personal service of any summons, complaint or

                                          OF ACTION ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR
                                          IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, THE EXECUTION, DELIVERY OR
                                          PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF THE AGREEMENT, AND/OR THE
                                          RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM. The scope
                                          of this waiver is intended to be all encompassing of any and all disputes that may
                                          be filed in any court or other tribunal (including contract claims, tort claims, breach
                                          of duty claims, and all other common law and statutory claims). THIS WAIVER IS
                                          IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY
                                          OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT
                                          AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE
                                          AGREEMENT, AND RELATED DOCUMENTS, OR TO ANY OTHER
                                          DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THIS TRANSACTION OR
                                          ANY RELATED TRANSACTION.
                                (D)       Filing of Agreement. In the event of litigation, the Agreement may be filed, under
                                          seal, for any permissible purpose, including to establish the Parties' consent to a
                                          trial by the court and their waiver of the right to recover punitive damages.
                       20.4     Continued Performance. Except as otherwise directed by the other Party, each Party
                                shall continue performing its obligations under the Agreement while a dispute is being
                                resolved except to the extent the issue in dispute precludes performance (dispute over
                                payment shall not be deemed to preclude performance), and without limiting either Party's
                                right to terminate the Agreement as provided in Article 19.
             21.       GENERAL
                       21.1     Governing Law/Venue. The Agreement and performance under it shall be governed by
                                and construed in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard
                                to any portion of its choice of law principles that might provide for application of a different
                                jurisdiction’s law; provided, however, that to the maximum extent permitted under
                                Applicable Laws, the Agreement shall not be subject to the Uniform Computer Information
                                Transactions Act (prepared by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform
                                State Laws) as currently enacted or as may be codified or amended from time to time by
                                any jurisdiction. The Parties consent to and agree that venue is proper with, and any and
                                all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to the Agreement shall be subject to the
                                exclusive jurisdiction of, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond
                                Division), or the Circuit Court of the County of Henrico, Virginia. The Parties consent to
                                the jurisdiction of such courts, agree to accept service of process by mail and irrevocably
                                and unconditionally waive any jurisdictional or venue (including inconvenient forum)
                                defenses otherwise available.
                       21.2     Binding Nature and Assignment. The Agreement shall be binding on the Parties hereto
                                and their respective successors and assigns. Neither Party may, or shall have the power

                                hereunder, without the prior consent of the other, except that Capital One may assign its
                                rights and delegate its obligations under the Agreement without the approval of Supplier
                                to: (A) an entity which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of Capital One, Capital
                                One Bank (USA), National Association, Capital One, National Association, or COFC; (B)
                                to any Affiliate; (C) to the successor in a merger, acquisition or liquidation of Capital One,

                                Affiliates. Subject to the foregoing, any assignment by operation of law, order of any court,
                                or pursuant to any plan of merger, consolidation or liquidation, shall be deemed an
                                assignment for which prior consent is required, and any assignment made without any such
                                consent shall be void and of no effect as between the Parties.
                       21.3     Mutually Negotiated. The terms and conditions of the Agreement (including any perceived
                                ambiguity herein) shall not be construed in favor of, or against, either Party by reason of
                                the extent to which either Party or its professional advisors participated in the preparation
                                of the original or any further drafts of the Agreement.
                       21.4     Notices. All notices, requests, demands and determinations under the Agreement (other
                                than routine operational communications), shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly

                                Either Party may from time to time change its address or designee for notification purposes
                                (as long as in the United States) by giving the other Party prior notice of the new address
                                or designee and the date upon which it will become effective.
                       21.5     Counterparts. The Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, any of which
                                manually signed signature pages may be delivered by facsimile or through the transmission
                                of an electronically scanned version, each of which shall be considered an original and,
                                taken together, shall constitute but one and the same agreement.
                       21.6     Relationship of Parties. In furnishing the Services, Supplier is acting as an independent
                                contractor, and Supplier has the sole right and obligation to supervise, manage, contract,
                                direct, procure, perform or cause to be performed, all work to be performed by Supplier
                                under the Agreement. The Parties do not intend to create a contract of agency, a joint
                                venture or a partnership of any type. Supplier is not an agent of Capital One and has no
                                authority to represent Capital One as to any matters, except as expressly authorized in the
                                Agreement.
                       21.7     Non-Exclusivity. The Agreement is non-exclusive and shall not be deemed to be a
                                requirements contract. Capital One shall be free without obligation to Supplier to perform
                                itself, or acquire from other third parties, services similar or identical to the Services
                                provided hereunder.
                       21.8     Severability. If any provision of the Agreement conflicts with the law under which the
                                Agreement is to be construed, or if any such provision is held invalid by a competent
                                authority, such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible
                                the original intentions of the Parties in accordance with Applicable Laws. The remainder
                                of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
                       21.9     Survival. Any provision of the Agreement that contemplates performance or observance
                                subsequent to termination or expiration of the Agreement shall survive termination or
                                expiration of the Agreement and continue in full force and effect including the provisions of
                                Articles 6 ("Proprietary Rights"), 9 ("Audits; Records Retention") and 13 ("Confidentiality;
                                Safeguarding of Information").
                       21.10    Public Disclosures.
                                (A)       All media releases, public announcements and public disclosures by either Party
                                          relating to the Agreement or the subject matter of the Agreement, including
                                          promotional or marketing material (but not including announcements intended
                                          solely for internal distribution or disclosures to the extent required to meet legal or
                                          regulatory requirements beyond the reasonable control of the disclosing Party)
                                          shall be coordinated with and approved by the other Party prior to release.
                                (B)       If a Party determines that disclosure is required to meet legal or regulatory
                                          requirements, it shall promptly inform the other Party and to the extent reasonably
                                          practicable coordinate such disclosure with the other Party. The disclosing Party
                                          shall limit disclosure to that which is necessary and shall give due consideration to

                 12.01     Definition of Cloud Services
                           The use of the term “cloud” suggests a different multi-tenant IT hosting environment than
                           traditional IT hosted services environments (like mainframes or traditional application hosting
                           providers).
                           For the purposes of this Agreement, Capital One follows the National Institute of Standards
                           and Technology (SP 800-145) to establish whether or not Supplier is a public cloud service.
                           Characteristics that identify a service as “cloud” are:
                                 •    On-demand Self-Service: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing
                                      capabilities.
                                 •    Broad Network Access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed
                                      through standard mechanisms that promote use by thin or thick client platforms, both
                                      mobile and fixed.
                                 •    Resource Pooling: The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve
                                      multiple consumers in a multi-tenant model, with resources dynamically assigned
                                      and reassigned according to demand. Examples of resources include storage,
                                      processing, memory and network bandwidth.
                                 •    Rapid Elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some
                                      cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with
                                      demand.
                                 •    Measured Service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use
                                      by leveraging a metering capability appropriate to the type of service. Resource
                                      usage can be monitored, controlled and reported, providing transparency for both
                                      the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
                           Further, third parties who are cloud providers offer different types of IT services within their
                           cloud environment, with each having their own specific risk concerns. Third parties who
                           utilize cloud service providers as part of the Services fall into one of these categories. There
                           are three distinct Cloud Service Models:
                                 •    SaaS - Software as a Service: The capability provided to the consumer is to use
                                      the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure.
                                 •    PaaS - Platform as a Service: The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy
                                      onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created
                                      using programming languages, libraries, services and tools supported by the
                                      provider.
                                 •    IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service: The capability provided to the consumer is to
                                      provision processing, storage, networks and other fundamental computing resources
                                      where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include
                                      operating systems and applications.
                 12.02     Non Use of Cloud
                           Supplier shall not utilize cloud services and/or providers to provide the Services to Capital
                           One.

             13.11 REMEDIATION              OF IA TPM FINDINGS
             Supplier agrees to remediate vulnerabilities detected during Capital One’s risk assessment of Supplier
             security and operational controls according to the following criteria:
                       A. For purposes of this section, vulnerabilities will be classified at the discretion of Capital One as
                       follows:
                                (i) an “Extreme” or “High Finding” has a high probability of exposing Capital One
                                Confidential Information to unauthorized viewing, modification, deletion or acquisition
                                as well as attacks that could result in data corruption;
                                (ii) a “Medium Finding” involves a potential compromise or loss of Capital One
                                Confidential Information which is possible based on the failure to observe security
                                requirements specified in the Agreement; and
                                (iii) a “Low Finding” involves threats that:
                                          (1) are considered extremely difficult for attackers to exploit;
                                          (2) have a low probability of being exercised, and/or
                                          (3) if exploited, are of minor consequence to the security of Capital One
                                          Confidential Information.
                       B. Extreme and High Findings
                                (i) Planning. Supplier shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide remediation
                                plans within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the risk assessment report of findings. If
                                such timeline for providing a remediation plan isn’t practicably, Supplier shall engage
                                Capital One in an iterative process to mutually work on developing a remediation plan.
                                (ii) Remediation. Supplier shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remediate
                                Extreme and High Findings within three (3) months from the report date. If such
                                remediation timeline isn’t practicable, then Supplier shall participate in biweekly status
                                update meeting with Capital One to discuss the remediation efforts until such finding is
                                remediated or otherwise agreed to in writing by both Parties.
                       C. Medium Findings

                                (i) Planning. Supplier shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide remediation
                                plans within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the risk assessment report of findings.
                                (ii) Remediation. Supplier shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remediate
                                Medium Findings within six (6) months from the report date. If such remediation
                                timeline isn’t practicable, then Supplier shall participate in biweekly status update
                                meeting with Capital One to discuss the remediation efforts until such finding is
                                remediated.
                       D. Low Findings
                                (i) Supplier shall provide remediation plans in response to the risk assessment report of
                                findings.
                                (ii) Mutually agreed upon low findings shall be remediated within a timeframe agreed to
                                in writing by both Parties.
                       E. If Supplier, despite its best efforts, is unable to correct a security vulnerability within the
                       timeframes specified above, Capital One may, in its discretion and in writing, extend the
                       timeframe for correction. If Supplier is unable to correct the security vulnerability, Capital One
                       may, without liability, terminate the Services as of a date specified in a notice of termination.
